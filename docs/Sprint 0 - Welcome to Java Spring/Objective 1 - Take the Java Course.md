## Pros and Cons

I am glad you are taking the time to look at the Java Course. Of course I am biased but I think it is a great course. By the way, I am the instructor, John Mitchell! However, I want you to make an informed decision. Should you pursue the Java track or stay with the JavaScript Node track? Keep reading and find out!

### The Good

- You want a challenge. You want to learn something new. You want to explore a different branch of the programming language family.
- You want to broaden your skills by learning a new technology. You want something to set yourself apart from other job applications. Java is frequency listed as one of the top three most sought after programming languages.
- More lines of Java code exist than any other programming language.
- Java is a broad language found on IoT devices to full website servers.
- You appreciate order, structure, boundaries over a flexible free-wheeling approach.
  - I like to think of Java as Strict Mother, you do must do things my way and you will be fine vs. JavaScript being a fun aunt, of course you can do that anyway you want but it could get you in real trouble!

### The Bad

- You will spend more hours per day learning Java vs. Node (JavaScript). Java is not necessarily harder but it is new.
  - To be a productive Java programmer, you will need to continuing studying Java Spring after the course. Materials and resources are provided to do this. However, this does require extra work on your part!
- Java is very structured. You code Javaâ€™s way or not at all. Node and JavaScript are much more flexible.
- The Lambda School community is more connected to JavaScript so in Java be prepared to seek much outside help.
- You have more software to install!

### Other Considerations

- Are you more interested in being a frontend or backend developer.
  - If you are leaning towards frontend, stay with Node. Your JavaScript skills will improve
  - If you are leaning towards backend, you have a choice!
- Location. Look into the Job Market where you want to work. Some areas concentrate more on one web stack or another.
  - Colorado has more Java positions than Node positions
  - San Fransisco has more Node than Java positions but still has plenty of jobs to go around
  - Washington State has a large amount of both
  - The Research Triangle in North Carolina tends to favor Java over Node
  - Do research into where you want to work and see what is available. Quick searches by city on LinkedIn, Glassdoor, and Indeed can give you really good information.
- Company size. Larger companies tend more towards Java while startups tend more towards Node.
- Established companies tend to be using Java more than Node. Java has been around longer. This is especially true in established industries like finance and health care.

### Final Thoughts

All that being said I have spoken to startup companies in Southern California that use Java for their full stack. Bottomline, research the area where you wish to work and companies you wish to work for and then make an informed decision!

I hope you join us in the Java class. If you do not, you can always take the Java class on your own and reach out to me for help! Also ask to the join the `JX` channel on Lambda School's Slack - a wealth of information and experience! BTW: JX = Java Experience!!!
